# Final Project
This is a work in progress of my final project. I have the basic
HTML layout set up for 3 of my favorite records whose images display, some text
that describes clicking each image will display that album information.
I also have my getElementById functions set up for what I want to happen when
a click occurs. The piece I'm still working on is my API connection to lastFM
I am using last weeks assignment as a skeleton to get the data, although I want
more than just the album name (tracks as well) so that's what I'm currently working on.
Then I'll need to make sure the proper data is retrieved on each click. I also want to add
some basic styling so it doesn't just look so bland but that will probably be the last thing I do.
