# Final Project
This is a work in progress of my final project. I have the basic
HTML layout set up for 3 of my favorite records whose images display, some text
that describes clicking each image will display that album information.
I also have my getElementById functions set up for what I want to happen when
a click occurs. The piece I'm still working on is my API connection to lastFM
I am using last weeks assignment as a skeleton to get the data, although I want
more than just the album name (tracks as well) so that's what I'm currently working on.
Then I'll need to make sure the proper data is retrieved on each click. I also want to add
some basic styling so it doesn't just look so bland but that will probably be the last thing I do.

Update for final:

Here is my completed project. I was able to make my data connection to LastFM and return
album/artist data to my page. Each album displays the artist, album title and list of tracks. 
I was going back and forth with exactly how to get back the data and I ended up doing some digging and having good luck using 
the fetch function. It seemed more straightforward to me and worked after a couple experiments. The styling is pretty basic, I mainly
just focused this whole week on bringing everything together just to have a functioning page. I'd like to experiment more with styling but
I felt the most important elements were in the javascript. I wasn't sure how to get rid of the numbers pertaining to the tracks list, so maybe thats something else to experiment with as well. I can't believe I made it to the end, this was by far the most challenging course
I've ever taken at Berklee. I don't know if I'll ever look at a piece of code again, but I certainly am much more in tune with what is 
happening behind the scenes on the web.
